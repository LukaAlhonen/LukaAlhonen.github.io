            <h4>
              Hello!
            </h4>
            <p>
              My name is Luka and I am a 22-year-old third year computer engineering student at 
              Åbo Akademi University from Turku, Finland. Computer science and 
              software development have been interests of mine for quite some time. 
              I had my first introduction to programming at the age of 16, 
              with the python programming language and soon after I started using the 
              Linux operating system as my daily driver.
              <br><br>
              During my studies and free time I have matured my programming 
              skills by learning more about data structures, algorithms, security, 
              web technologies, design patterns and more. 
              <br><br>
              As a worker I have been told by Employers and Officers in the army that 
              I am very diligent and able to learn from and receive feedback and 
              constructive criticism very well.
            </p>
            <h3>
              Education
            </h3>
            <p>
              I graduated from Borgå Gymnasium upper secondary school in 2019 
              and started my compulsory military service, during which I received 
              leadership training as an NCO. In the autumn of 2020 I began my computer 
              engineering studies at Åbo Akademi and I am currently finishing up my bachelors 
              degree, which I hope to receive by the end of spring 2023.
              <br><br>
              During my studies I have completed courses in software development, algorithms, 
              databases, web technologies, computer networks and security, computer 
              architecture, systems and control engineering, physics and mathematics.

            <h4>Software development</h4>
            During my three years of computer engineering studies and during my free time I have gained
            experience in software development through writing different kinds of apps (including fullstack web apps). 
            A number of these apps can be found under the Projects tab. 
            I have experience with a lot of common and widely used programming languages and technologies, including
            Python, Java, javascript, git/github, azure, etc. 
            I currently have no real job experience in software development or IT but I do have experience from my studies and free time

            <p>
              A fullstack web app written in <strong>django</strong> and <strong>react</strong>, with a sqlite database.
              <br>
              This is a webshop app I made according to specifications, for a web technologies course.
              <br>
              Anyone can browse the shop, but in order to buy or sell items, one has to register and log in to the site.
              <br><br>
              The site is hosted on <strong>Azure App Service</strong> and can be found <a href="https://lukaswebshop.azurewebsites.net"><strong>Here</strong></a>

            <h4><a href="https://github.com/it-teaching-abo-akademi/project-pvp22-grupp-sjutton">Cash Register System</a></h4>
            <p>
              A cash register system I created together with my group for a software development course.
              <br>
              The app is written in Java and was created according to specifications.
              <br>
              The cashbox, cardreader and product catalogs are emulated by Java applications.
              <br>
              A user can "scan an item" by typing in the barcode associated with the item and remove an item by selecting it from the UI and clicking the remove button
              <br>
              A purchase can be made in cash or with a card payment and works by sending a POST request to the cashbox or cardreader.
              <br>
              The source code for the app can be found <strong><a href="https://github.com/it-teaching-abo-akademi/project-pvp22-grupp-sjutton">here</a></strong>
